/**
 * Candidate Programming Test
 * ________________________________________
 * <p>
 * This test forms part of the hiring process for Glory Software engineering candidates.
 * <p>
 * The text file Train Data.txt (attached) contains the details of trains departing from a train station.
 * <p>
 * Write a program in Java that loads Train Data.txt and provides the following features:
 * <p>
 * 1) Lists all trains displaying destination and departure time
 * 2) Enables a train to be selected and a window or aisle seat to be booked
 * 3) In the event a desired seat (window/aisle) is not available, offers the option of booking another available seat
 * 4) If no seats are available, offers the option of picking a different train to a different destination
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Assumptions:
 * <p>
 * 1) You can use any user interface technology e.g. Console Application, SWT, Swing, â€¦
 * <p>
 * 2) The fields in the text file are: Departure Time, Destination, total number of seats
 * <p>
 * 3) The total number of seats can be assumed to be an equal split between window and aisle.
 * For example, 12 total means 6 window and 6 aisle seats.
 * <p>
 * 4) The solution should be provided in a .zip file.
 * The .zip file should contain all files necessary to build the solution.
 * This includes source code but also all third-party Java libraries.
 * It is not necessary to provide libraries that are part of Java 11.
 * <p>
 * 5) The solution must contain build files to build it either in the Eclipse IDE, Ant or Maven.
